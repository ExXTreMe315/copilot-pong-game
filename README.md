# CoPilot Pong Game
I was bored and clicked on an example request for GitHub Copilot. The example was simply called “Pong Game” or something like that.

Anyway, Copilot automatically used the following prompt to generate the code of this repo.

## Prompt

Hi Copilot! Could you generate a simple Pong game utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? The player should control the left paddle with their mouse, and the right paddle should be controlled automatically by a basic AI. Make sure the game includes a bouncing ball and collision detection for paddles and walls. Please provide the code for all three components: the HTML file, the CSS file, and the JavaScript file directly within the chat window. Thanks!
